The package can be installed using remotes:

```{r eval=F}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("LCBC-UiO/lcbcr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

The functions are now installed, and you may load them when you want to use them.
All functions are documented in standard R fashion.

The vignette and other presentations or tutorials of the package can also be found online [here](https://lcbc-uio.github.io/lcbcr/)
